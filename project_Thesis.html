									<h4>Summary</h4>
									<p>Codesign activities are increasingly used in the development of public services and policies. These approaches involve citizens in the design process, thus giving it a democratic value. However, few measures are currently in place to ensure that the epistemic value provided by participants is reflected in the final design. The objective of this project is to determine the type of ideas that can be lost during the synthesis moments of codesign activities, and then to indicate possible solutions to make the process more&nbsp;democratic.</p>

								<h2>The Project</h2>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Thesis/Thesis_Biblio.jpg" alt="" /></span>In the public sector context, the use of participatory design methods such as codesign approaches have gained momentum since the beginning of the 21st century. Many decision-makers see codesign as an opportunity to make the development of public services and policies more democratic, as this approach involves citizens in the design process. Codesign activities enable ordinary citizens to communicate their complex realities, thereby allowing the development of solutions that are better adapted to their needs. However, the epistemic value provided by participants still needs to be effectively communicated to the designers and project sponsors to ensure a democratic codesign process.
									<br>In codesign activities, the synthesis and translation of the concepts that are proposed during plenary and wrap-up sessions can be problematic. For instance, ideas generated by a codesign team may be presented by a single team representative, who is often chosen for being the individual most comfortable speaking for the group. While this participant’s account of the group’s codesign outcomes is valid, it remains a single perspective; a single team representative may not reasonably represent the vision of all members of the group. Therefore, some ideas and nuances may inevitably be lost. Importantly, the ideas that are left out often come from more vulnerable participants, including minorities and those who have difficulty expressing their ideas in a conventional way.
									<br>To understand and address the problems surrounding this residual data, this research project presents and analyses the outcomes from a plenary session of a codesign activity organized at a public library in Montreal North, a disadvantaged borough of Montreal. This process examines the ideas and nuances presented by different participants through the presentations during the plenary sessions. By comparing the unique perspective of each participant, the issues and key moments of the plenary sessions can be identified. Subsequently, the hypothesized causes of why residual data are being created during the moments of synthesis are outlined and then discussed. Finally, this research presents speculative solutions for limiting the omission of epistemic data generated by vulnerable populations during the plenary sessions of codesign activities within a public project development.

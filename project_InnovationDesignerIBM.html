									<h4>Summary</h4><!--Explain the problem, the goal, the results-->
									<p><span style="color: #0f62fe; font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">Foreword: As I'm subject to a non-disclosure agreement for my projects at IBM, here's a presentation of my methodology for a typical project as an Innovation Designer in IBM Client Engineering.</span>
										<br><br>
										The role of Innovation Designer at IBM Client Engineering is to drive adoption to maximize the impact of IBM technologies for clients. Through workshops and co-creation, Innovation Designers identify challenges and opportunities that clients face to develop solutions addressing their needs and market demands. To achieve their objectives, they use a methodology that incorporates various design approaches, such as user research, collaborative design, and lean UX design. They then collaborate with cross-functional teams composed of developers, solution architects, and data scientists to build proof of concepts showcasing value to the client. Finally, they utilize storytelling to develop a narrative that allows clients and their executives to fully understand the solution and its benefits, promoting its implementation.										
									</p>
									<h4>My Role</h4>
									<p>Understanding the business and technological context of an enterprise, conducting stakeholder research, facilitating internal and external (client) workshops, co-creating with cross-functional teams to develop proofs of concept, designing UX and UI, storytelling, and presenting to clients and executives
										</p>
									<h4>Tools</h4>
										<p>Mural, Figma, Trello, monday.com, IBM technologies (watsonx, genarative AI, data and AI, conversational AI, etc.), Adobe Creative Cloud, Microsoft 365, Slack</p>

								<h2>Context</h2>
								<p>Client Engineering is a pre-sales team of multi-disciplinary experts that collaborates with clients to co-create and implement innovative solutions using IBM’s technologies. In just a few weeks, a project team can identify 	and research a use case, define a solution, and develop it to deliver value.
									<br><br>
									<i>As this is not a specific solution but rather a methodology, this “project” does not contain any particular context or data specific to a client engagement. However, the processes of research, solution definition, co-creation, and delivery of value will be explained to communicate my design approach as an Innovation Designer.

								</p>

								<h2>Research the Context</h2>
								<p>Based on a business opportunity identified by the sales team, the Client Engineering team prepares for its first meeting with the client. The designer's role is to develop and personalize design thinking activities to enable the team to fully understand the customer's pain points and challenges.
								<br>
								Depending on the project, research activities and/or workshops (remote, in-person, or hybrid) are conducted with the client's project teams. Here are the main topics of these workshops:
								</p>
								<h3>Align on the Business Use Case</h3>
								<p>To make sure that the business objectives of the client match the potential technology that the sales team identified, it’s often necessary to conduct activities such as the Business Landscape, the Opportunity Exploration/Prioritization, Business Opportunity Statement, etc.<br>
								</p>
								<h3>Discover the Technical Challenges</h3>
								<p>
									To understand the different technologies that the client currently uses how the technical solution could be integrated, the team needs to understand the client’s technical environment. The designer assists the Solution Architect to capture the technical architecture of the different systems and technologies in place that can be impacted by the solution.
								</p>
								<h3>Research the Stakeholders</h3>
								<p>
									Whether a technological solution is highly technical or not, it is essential for the designer to understand its users, as there is always a person who will interact with or be affected by it. Depending on the needs of the project, the designer may seek to understand users by facilitating activities such as Stakeholder Mapping and Empathy Mapping. They may also conduct ethnography sessions or interview users to understand their goals, needs, and challenges.
								</p>
								<h3>Understand the As-Is Processes</h3>
								<p>
									Finally, activities like the As-Is Process Discovery are run conjointly by the designer and the technical team to understand the flow of how the business opportunity, the technologies and stakeholders interact and where the challenges are.
								</p>
								<hr />
								<h2>Define a Solution</h2>
								<p>
									Once the context has been understood, the Client Engineering team must define the proof of concept to be developed. The designer's role is to guide the team in selecting the best use case (based on a real client project and/or problem) to showcase the solution. Then, the solution must be scoped to ensure that the proof of concept is achievable within 2 to 6 weeks of build (sprints) while demonstrating as much value as possible to the customer.
								</p>
								<h3>Select a Use Case</h3>
								<p>
									Choosing the right use case is essential to create a proof of concept that is valuable to the client. To help select the right use case, the designer can facilitate various activities such as Hopes and Fears, which helps identify the customer's ambitions in relation to the project, while capturing what needs to be avoided. Subsequently, a use case discovery activity, followed by prioritization according to impact and feasibility, helps identify the best client's use case that will provide a tangible foundation for the proof of concept.
								</p>
								<h3>Define the Proof of Concept</h3>
								<p>
									Once the project use case has been jointly selected, the team must define the solution to be implemented for the client. When necessary, this is the time to discover in greater detail the type of data to be used in the proof of concept, and to create the technical architecture of the solution's environment. It is also during this phase that the solution's “to-be scenario” will be mapped. In other words, what processes will be followed by the users, how the various technological modules will interact, where the data will be input, and what will be the outputs and results of the solution.
								</p>
								<h3>Scope the Proof of Concept</h3>
								<p>
									The last step before starting the build is the Proof of Concept Statement. This activity can be conceptualized as a contract between the Client Engineering team and the client team as to what will be built during the proof of concept. It involves agreeing and summarizing who are the stakeholders (users) of the solution, what will be built (an application, a customized demo, a software configuration, etc.), what will be the main functions of the solution, and which success criteria will be used to evaluate the proof of concept.

									<h4>Summary</h4><!--Explain the problem, the goal, the results-->
									<p><b><i>Foreword: As I'm subject to a non-disclosure agreement for my projects at IBM, here's a presentation of my methodology for a typical project as an Innovation Designer in IBM Client Engineering.</i></b>
										<br><br>
										The role of Innovation Designer at IBM Client Engineering is to drive adoption to maximize the impact of IBM technologies for clients. Through workshops and co-creation, Innovation Designers identify challenges and opportunities that clients face to develop solutions addressing their needs and market demands. To achieve their objectives, they use a methodology that incorporates various design approaches, such as user research, collaborative design, and lean UX design. They then collaborate with cross-functional teams composed of developers, solution architects, and data scientists to build proof of concepts showcasing value to the client. Finally, they utilize storytelling to develop a narrative that allows clients and their executives to fully understand the solution and its benefits, promoting its implementation.										
									</p>
									<h4>My Role</h4>
									<p>Understanding the business and technological context of an enterprise, conducting stakeholder research, facilitating internal and external (client) workshops, co-creating with cross-functional teams to develop proofs of concept, designing UX and UI, storytelling, and presenting to clients and executives
										</p>
									<h4>Tools</h4>
										<p>Mural, Figma, Trello, monday.com, IBM technologies (watsonx, genarative AI, data and AI, conversational AI, etc.), Adobe Creative Cloud, Microsoft 365, Slack</p>

								<h2>Context</h2>
								<p>IBM Client Engineering is... [to complete]
									<br><br>
									As this is not a specific project but rather a methodology, this “project” does not contain any particular context or data specific to a client engagement. However, the processes of research, solution development, validation, and presentation of results will be explained to communicate my design approach as an Innovation Designer.
